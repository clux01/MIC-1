# Introduction

This repository contains the work of a study project at the FH Joanneum.

The MIC-1 processor is implemented in SystemVerilog and executed on a FPGA board, with the ability to execute micro programs, swap programs and read and display the machine state and register values while running.

It is tested for the Basys-3 board.
